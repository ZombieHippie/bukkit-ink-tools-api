bukkit-ink-tools-api
====================

This plugin is made for Minecraft Bukkit servers. It uses a HUD to display different tools in specific slots in your inventory. This means that whatever item you are holding in your hand is the material that is used when right-clicking, the idea is that this would allow very quick changes from different tools and materials.

In practice it became very confusing and unusual to use for my players. Since then I have discontinued its development.
